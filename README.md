# Scroll "Video" Control

A frame-by-frame "video" controlled by user scroll position.

This project is something that I have dreamed of being able to create for myself for a long time.

The Problem I had.....
I ride horses and have always looked for a way to critique my riding position to better my abilities and see where I could improve.
I always wish that I could have precise control over my videos that I/someone would take of myself.
I would try to slow down the video enough to get a clear view of my position in a fast paced sport.

How I solved this problem...
I designed a way to do this precisely. I can now take a video that I captured of my riding, 
break it down frame by frame using Photoshop, 
and attach each image to the users scroll position.

The "video" can be played frame by frame, forwards and backwards, and the rider can study their position and improve their skills.
Success!!
